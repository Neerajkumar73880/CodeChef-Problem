Chef is currently facing the north direction. Each second he rotates exactly 90 degrees in clockwise direction. Find the direction in which Chef is facing after exactly 
X seconds.

Note: There are only 4 directions: North, East, South, West (in clockwise order).

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single integer X.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the direction in which Chef is facing after exactly XX seconds.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤X≤1000
Sample 1:
Input
3
1
3
6

Output
East
West
South

Explanation:
Chef is facing North in the starting.

Test Case 1: After 1 second he turns 90 degrees clockwise and now faces the east direction.

Test Case 2: Direction after 1 second- east

Direction after 2 seconds- south

Direction after 3 seconds- west
