Alice and Bob are very good friends and they always distribute all the eatables equally among themselves.

Alice has A chocolates and Bob has B chocolates. Determine whether Alice and Bob can distribute all the chocolates equally among themselves.

Note that:

It is not allowed to break a chocolate into more than one piece.
No chocolate shall be left in the distribution.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers AA and BB, the number of chocolates that Alice and Bob have, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line \texttt{YES}YES if Alice and Bob can distribute all the chocolates equally, else output \texttt{NO}NO. The output 
is case insensitive, i.e, \texttt{yes}yes, \texttt{YeS}YeS, \texttt{yES}yES will all be accepted as correct answers when Alice and Bob can distribute the
chocolates equally.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤A,B≤10^5
