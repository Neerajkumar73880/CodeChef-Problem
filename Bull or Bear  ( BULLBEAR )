Chef is on his way to become the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.

Given that Chef bought the stock at value X and sold it at value Y. Help him calculate whether he made a profit, loss, or was it a neutral deal.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers X and Y, denoting the value at which Chef bought and sold
the stock respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output PROFIT if Chef made a profit on the deal, LOSS if Chef incurred a loss on the deal, and NEUTRAL otherwise.

The checker is case-insensitive so answers like pROfiT, profit, and PROFIT would be considered the same.

Constraints
1≤T≤500
1≤X,Y≤100
Sample 1:
Input
4
4 2
8 8
3 4
2 1

Output
LOSS
NEUTRAL
PROFIT
LOSS

Explanation:
Test case 1: Since the cost price is greater than the selling price, Chef made a loss in the deal.

Test case 2: Since the cost price is equal to the selling price, the deal was neutral.

Test case 3: Since the cost price is less than the selling price, Chef made a profit in the deal.

Test case 4: Since the cost price is greater than the selling price, Chef made a loss in the deal.
