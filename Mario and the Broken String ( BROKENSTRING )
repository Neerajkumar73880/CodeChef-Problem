Mario was going to gift Princess Peach a string S of even length N.

Mario was clumsy and thus, broke the string in the middle. He now has two strings A and B such that A=S[1,N/2] and B=S[N/2+1,N].

Mario is not sure about the order in which he should join the strings AA and BB to get the string SS. Thus, he joins the strings in any random order.
Find whether it is guaranteed that Mario will get the same string S if he joins the strings A and B in any order.

Note that S[L,R] denotes a substring of string S starting at index L and having a length (R−L+1).

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input:
The first line of each test case contains NN - the length of the initial string S.
The second line contains the string S.
Output Format
For each test case, print YES if it is guaranteed that Mario will get the same string SS irrespective of the order in which he joins the strings A
and B and NO otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

Constraints
1≤T≤3000
1≤N≤1000
N is even.
S consists of lowercase english alphabets.

Sample 1:
Input
4
6
abcabc
6
abcdef
4
aaaa
4
baab

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO

Explanation:
Test case 1: On breaking, the string S gives A=abc and B=abc. Thus, joining it in either way (AB or BA), would give the same string SS.

Test case 2: On breaking, the string S gives A=abc and B=def. Joining it as BA would give the string defabc which is not equal to string S.

Test case 3: On breaking, the string S gives A=aa and B=aa. Thus, joining it in either way (AB or BA), would give the same string S.

Test case 4: On breaking, the string S gives A=ba and B=ab. Joining it as BA would give the string abba which is not equal to string S.
