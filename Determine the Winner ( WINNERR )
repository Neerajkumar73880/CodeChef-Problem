There is a contest containing 2 problems A and B.

2 strong participants P and Q participated in the contest and solved both the problems.

P made AC submissions on problems A and B at time instants Pa and Pb respectively while Q made AC submissions on problems A and B at time instants Qa and Qb.

It is given that the time penalty is the minimum time instant at which a participant has solved both the problems. Also the participant with the lower time
penalty will have a better rank.

Determine which participant got the better rank or if there is a TIE.

Input Format
The first line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, four integers Pa, Pb, Qa, Qb.
Output Format
For each test case, output P if P got a better rank, Q if Q got a better rank, TIE otherwise.

Note that output is case-insensitive i.e. P and p both are considered the same.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤Pa,Pb,Qa,Qb<=100
