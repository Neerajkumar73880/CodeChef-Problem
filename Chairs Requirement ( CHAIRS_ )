Chef's coding class is very famous in Chefland.

This year X students joined his class and each student will require one chair to sit on. Chef already has Y chairs in his class. Determine the minimum 
number of new chairs Chef must buy so that every student is able to get one chair to sit on.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X and Y — the number of students in the class and the number of chairs Chef already has.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of extra chairs Chef must buy so that every student gets one chair.

Constraints
