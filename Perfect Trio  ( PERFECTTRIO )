The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers A, B and C — the age of the three members of group.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the group is perfect, and NO otherwise.

You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings YES, yes, Yes, and yES are considered identical.

Constraints
1≤T≤200
1≤A,B,C≤100
Sample 1:
Input
4
10 20 30
23 51 17
44 21 23
30 30 30

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO

Explanation:
Test case 1: The sum of age of first and second person is equal to that of the third person. Thus, the group is perfect.

Test case 2: There exists no member in the group such that the age of one person is equal to the sum of the age of remaining two people. Thus, the group is not perfect.

Test case 3: The sum of age of second and third person is equal to that of the first person. Thus, the group is perfect.

Test case 4: There exists no member in the group such that the age of one person is equal to the sum of the age of remaining two people. Thus, the group is not perfect.
