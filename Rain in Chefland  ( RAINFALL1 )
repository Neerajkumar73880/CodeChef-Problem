In Chefland, precipitation is measured using a rain gauge in millimetre per hour.

Chef categorises rainfall as:

LIGHT, if rainfall is less than 3 millimetre per hour.
MODERATE, if rainfall is greater than equal to 3 millimetre per hour and less than 7 millimetre per hour.
HEAVY if rainfall is greater than equal to 7 millimetre per hour.
Given that it rains at X millimetre per hour on a day, find whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X — the rate of rainfall in millimetre per hour.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.

You may print each character in lowercase or uppercase. For example, LIGHT, light, Light, and liGHT, are all identical.

Constraints
1≤T≤20
1≤X≤20
Sample 1:
Input
4
1
20
3
7

Output
LIGHT
HEAVY
MODERATE
HEAVY

Explanation:
Test case 1: The rate of precipitation is less than 3. Thus, the rain is LIGHT.

Test case 2: The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to 7. Thus, the rain is HEAVY.

Test case 3: The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to 3 and less than 7. Thus, the rain is MODERATE.

Test case 4: The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to 7. Thus, the rain is HEAVY.
